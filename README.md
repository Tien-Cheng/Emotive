# Emotive: Emotion Tracking with Deep Learning

This repository contains the main code for the Emotive web application. Emotive is an emotion tracker that relies on deep learning to classify facial emotions.

Work has been done since the end of the assignment to migrate this project from GitLab to GitHub. It was originally an assignment project developed by Faqih and I for our DevOps module.

The site and deep learning model is hosted on Heroku. The code for the model is located in another repository.
